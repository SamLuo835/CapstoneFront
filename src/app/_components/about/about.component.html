    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The Office for Sustainability (OfS) is collaborating with The Region of Peel to develop the Sheridan Bike Hub for the Hazel McCallion and Davis campuses. 
        The program builds on successful cycling initiatives already in place at the college and it aims to increase cycling for transportation among our students, 
        faculty and staff on both campuses.</p>
        <p>The present software aims to provide an overall better experience for the users, leading to having more people cycling. It also makes the users spend 
            less time on the management process, being able to focus on new projects or in improving the userâ€™s experience in general</p>
